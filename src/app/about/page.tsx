        Hygiene paper products are designed for single use, which promotes proper disposal practices. This reduces the likelihood of germs lingering on surfaces and spreading to other individuals. Properly disposed of paper products ensures that germs and bacteria are contained and eliminated effectively. Moreover, there are numerous recycled paper products.

        In healthcare settings, the use of hygienic paper products is vital for infection control. Paper products like disposable gowns, masks, and sheets prevent the spread of pathogens between patients and healthcare workers. Tissues and paper towels are also used to maintain clean environments and manage bodily fluids safely.
